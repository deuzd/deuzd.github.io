## Introduction
  Artificial Intelligence has rapidly become a significant part of the educational experience, particularly in fields like software engineering where problem-solving, design, and collaboration are central. AI tools such as ChatGPT, Google Bard, and GitHub Copilot have emerged as powerful assistants that can help clarify concepts, generate code, and debug errors. In ICS 314, AI served both as a resource for quick answers and as a partner in exploration.
  Prior to this class I had used AI in some of my other classes outside of ICS such as physics to help explain concepts that the textbook either didn't go over clearly or if it was something I was just stuck on. AI has proved to be a useful tool in all fields though it is important to not develop an overdependent relationship to it and let it take away the ability to think for one's self.

## Personal Experience with AI
  For the exercises I used AI to help build a framework for what to do for the assignment, using what it gave me as a template as to what I was supposed to do for the actual assignment. Since there are some instructions that doesn't quite translate directly to what AI can do, sometimes I would ask it for simpler steps that wouldn't give away the answer right away such as asking it how to search for an item in the given data without using certain  functions, as some of the exercises asked that we did not use certain functions since it would ruin the point of the exercie. The online WODS that we had also had elements where we couldn't use certain functions or had to base our code off of a picture, to which AI is not that great at reading. For those I would try to code it as best as I could then if I still needed help I would copy what I had and ask ChatGPT what was wrong if I wasn't getting the desired outcome, to which it helped me figure it out. For the essays I did not rely on AI as much as I feel like those essays were more about personal experience, which to me means that there shouldn't be a need to rely on AI beyond maybe grammar checking, which is still a very helpful tool. For our final project I did use AI to help create a template of what the different pages could look like, since my group did the UH clubs project I asked AI to make a page template that would fit the theme of what our other existing pages looked like in order to make the pages look more cohesive even though it was done by different people. I don't really consider myself to be very artistic so having AI help create the background and choose the colors really helped me. In terms of my overall learning in this class I asked ChatGPT to help with some concepts that I felt like I needed  more practice on, such as using Bootstrap5 or understanding ESlint. There were some times when I would watch the videos of the assignments and still be confused, either from my own misunderstanding or the video being a bit dated so the instructions were different or the program they used was different from what we use now. For questions I didn't ask many and most times they seemed to be simple fixes so I did not use AI for that as I wanted to know if maybe other people were experiencing the same problem as I was or if I could help someone and tell them what worked for me, as I feel like then it feels more personal than just giving an answer that I copy and pasted from AI. Asking for coding examples really helped because it gave me the opportunity to still learn while almost having a tutor walk me through the steps. If I didn't know why my code wasn't showing up on local host I would ask ChatGPT where I went wrong but I would sometimes ask it not to give me the solution, only where the error occured so it would give me the chance to solve it on my own and if not I could ask for hints, similar to how a teacher wouldn't always just give the answer but give helpful nudges in the right direction. Sometimes if there were sections of code that were repetitive and I didn't want to copy and paste it only to have to scroll through it I would just paste it into AI and then ask it to "use the exact same format but replace the module names with 'a, b, c, etc.' so that I could just copy it from there and paste it, which to me saved a lot of time and effort. When I did ask for answers from ChatGPT I did like that sometimes it would give its own comments explaining what certain blocks of code did which I found really helpful when reading through it as it gave me insight like "calculates the average score for x surfer". In a class like this where quality is very important using things like ESlint using AI to help clean up code also was a big time saver. While on VSCode there are the quick fixes sometimes the fixes would elect to ignore the problem or add a rule that overrides that rule, though there is a solution to fix it. So using AI helped fix those small errors that, while it may seem insignificant, affects the quality and functionality of your overall product. Even some instances I found it useful as when we were supposed to download PostgresSQL I had some errors on my part and the guide didn't seem to have a fix for it, which may very well be on my end. Luckily I was able to ask AI if they knew what was wrong and they were able to help me finish the installation which I was very thankful for.

## Conclusion
  While I did stress the importance of not being over reliant on AI that does not mean I deject the idea or notion of using it because whether we like it or not, AI is around to stay and is only getting better and better. And there are times when we need to use every tool available and if AI is there, then you are simply using every tool at your disposal to help bring out the best outcome possible.
