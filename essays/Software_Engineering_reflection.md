  Agile project management and configuration management are common applications in web development, and are important tools for software engineering due to their ability to be widely adapted to a plethora of projects beyond just web development.

## Agile Project Management and Issue Driven Management
  Agile project management is a method that focuses on things like fliexibility, collaboration, and incrementing progess. It has an emphasis on iterative development, meaning that the projects can be broken down into smaller parts called "sprints" similar to a divide and conquer algorithm. Each sprint has a cycle of planning, development, testing, and review, which helps teams adapt to change. One  of the most helpful features of it is that it allows the user to adjust the scope of work as needed in the event priorities change or some problem arises. A specific style in Agile is Issue Driven Project Management (IDPM) where a project is organized to address specific issues. Issues is a blanket term that covers things from bugs to new features that have some priority. Each issue is seen as a smaller unite of the work, allowing for steady progress.

  This can be applied to many things outside of web applicatoins like software development of embedded systems, which may involve hardware or firmware in additoin to software, where Agile principles could come in handy. Using an issue driven approach can help focus on fixing problems or implementing features that align with the user's needs.

## Configuration Management
  Configuration management refers to systematically managing and controlling changes to the components of software such as settings and dependencies. This is extremely helpful when there are multiple versions of the same project due to the different stages of development. The goal of configuration management is consistency and stability during development, as well as tracking changes.

  One well known purpose for this type of management is Git, where teams can track changes to codebases and merge different versions of code. It also includes managing infrastructure, maintaining consistency in development, testing, and production.

## Conclusion
  Agile and Configuration management are essential for web application along with other uses for software engineering. Agile is very adaptable which suits it for many different aspects like embedded systems and IoT, where constant iterations can help with progress. Configuration management is very helful when it comes to complex systems, ensuring consistency and stability in the development process. There are core priniciples in software engineering that have many applications beyond just web development.
