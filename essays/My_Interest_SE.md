## What makes Software Engineering so Interesting?

I think to me the reason why I think software engineering is so interesting is the same reason why I like computer science in the first place. We are entering an era where almost everything is digital and I want to be apart of that step into the digital age. Ever since I was little I was fascinated with computers and how there were all these different applications that could do so many things from games, to essays, to search engines. As I grew up I had more resources available to me and people who were willing to teach me which further grew my interest in computer science as a whole.

What I think makes software engineering so cool is its wide usage in the real world. Testing and debugging, algorithms and structures, and security databases all are foundations if not byproducts of software developement. While I may not be proficient in all those fields I think the thing that drove me was that this was one of the few things that failing made me more determined. A lot of times many people get frustrated when they can't solve something yet it feels ecstatic when you do and that's how I feel about stuff like software engineering. While it may be hard and there will be setbacks, sometimes it drives me even more to try and solve that problem I couldn't before.

What I hope to gain from this is the drive to continue to want to learn and understand more. I see myself getting some kind of job in the computer science field and as such there will be difficulties along the way. What I hope to gain is a strong sense of work ethic and practice that'll allow me to keep on going and wanting to learn and experience even more.
