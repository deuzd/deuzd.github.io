## Overview

The Problem: Many college students go through mental health struggles as they preapre to leave behind their school life and dive into the working world. Some may be unaware that there are available counseling services, peer support groups, and wellness programs, which could enhance their mental well-being.

The Solution: Mental Health and Wellness hub designed for UH Manoa students. The platform will provide information on available resources such as allowing students to make counseling appointments.

## Approach

Homepage: An overview of the platform, allowing users to sign up or log in. It showcases featured wellness articles, upcoming events, and easy access to resources.

Resource Directory: A categorized list of mental health resources, including counselors, emergency contacts, wellness groups, and workshops.

Personalized Dashboard: Once logged in, users will see recommended resources, saved articles, and upcoming wellness events.

Event Page: Details about upcoming mental health workshops, group therapy sessions, and yoga classes, with options to sign up or register.

## Use Case Ideas

First-time User Registration: A new student signs up, providing optional information about their interests (e.g., mindfulness, exercise, peer support). Based on these preferences, the dashboard is tailored with specific resources.

Booking a Counseling Appointment: A user logs in, navigates to the counselor booking page, and schedules a session based on available times.

Event Registration: A user receives a notification about a wellness workshop, navigates to the event page, and registers.

## Beyond the Basics

Personalized Wellness Recommendations: Based on user profile and engagement history, users receive unique recommendations for workshops, articles, or support groups.

In-App Wellness Tracker: Users can log their daily wellness activities, such as exercise or meditation, and see weekly summaries to track their progress.
