## BootStrap5 and my experience
  In my experienc using Bootstrap5 I ound it very helpful to have things taht are prebuilt for easier usage. Such things like logos, buttons, and templates are readily available for use to which it makes it easier for people who may be new to html or css, like myself. While I do understand the importance of learning independence when coding there is no need to brute force your way through something when there are tools there for your benefit. An example would be like taking a test but not using the formula sheet the professor gives you. There is merit in being able to do everything by yourself though there is nothing wrong with getting help, especially when it is offered with no restriction. Another example would be the spellcheck feature, where one may not need it but having is a nice touch and an improvement on quality of life.

## From a software engineering perspective
  From a software engineering perspective Bootstrap5 offers many helpful features to be utilized, such as facilitating rapid development. The framework provides a comprehensive library of pre-built components, such as buttons, modals, and navigation bars, which developers can utilize to quickly prototype applications. This capability allows for faster iteration and feedback cycles, enabling teams to test ideas and features without the need for extensive custom coding. Utilizing a common framework ensures that UI elements across an application maintain a uniform appearance, thereby enhancing usability and reducing design discrepancies. This adherence to a coherent design language is particularly beneficial in team environments, where multiple developers collaborate on a project.

## Conclusion
  Bootstrap5 allows for many quality of life improvements and has a place even in the professional setting. So while it may seem like a tool to hold your hand through some stages of development it offers many benefits that one can utilize in order to become a more proficient worker overall, and there is nothing wrong with that.
